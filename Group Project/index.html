      <h1>What is communication?</h1></p>

      What does communication mean to you? </p>
      
      Now whatever answer you came up with, imagine a world without it, and you will get a pretty decent idea of what communication at its essence means. </p>
  
      A more dictionary-esque definition of communication is <strong> ‘Communication is the act or process of transferring information from one place, person or group to another.’</strong></p> 
  
      For communication to take place, there must be three essential components: the sender, a medium, and the receiver. </p>
  
      There are many different types of communication. These include: </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Verbal Communication:</strong>Sharing of information through verbal means i.e speech. </li>
        <li><strong>Non-Verbal Communication:</strong>Community that takes place through means other than spoken language. For instance, body language, eye contact, posture, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Written Communication: </strong>Communication that takes place where the encoding of a message is done in written form i.e through pen and paper. </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Importance of Communication</h2></p>
      Human communication is one of the most important aspects of life. It is an effective means of development adopted between individuals and groups alike.</p>

 

        Communication skills are the abilities that are used when giving and receiving information in its various forms, which enable a person to pass information to other people and to understand what is said to him.</p>
        
         
        
        Communication skills have become one of the basic requirements for personal and institutional development. </p>
        
        Well-developed communication skills are essential for a child's academic success and successful future career. At all levels of education, students should be able to communicate effectively.</p>
        
         
        
        Communication skills are an essential leadership function and a major characteristic of a good leader.</p>
        
        Communication skills and effective leadership styles are closely intertwined. Lack of communication skills can make team members uncomfortable and unenthusiastic about their work while good communication skills help a team work together to achieve the desired goals.</p>
        
         
        
        Having strong communication skills helps in all aspects of life, from people's professional lives to the transition to their personal lives, and everything that falls in between. All life transactions result from communication.</p>
        
        Communication skills help achieve the goals planned in advance, provide a clear-cut vision about those goals, and achieve good preparation for them in an appropriate environment.</p>
        
         
        
        Communication skills are of the utmost importance when providing health care services. Effective communication is bidirectional between patients and healthcare systems.</p>
        
        Communication skills can enable patients and their family members to participate as full partners in their care and are proven to improve adherence to treatment and self-management.</p>
        
         
        
        When you are interviewing for a job, the hiring manager may ask you about communication skills. The ability to communicate effectively with superiors, colleagues and employees is essential, regardless of the industry in which you work.</p>
        
         
        
        Communication skills are also very important in business. They can help foster a good working relationship between you and your employees, which in turn can improve morale and efficiency.</p>
        
        Communication skills help you develop meaningful relationships with subordinates, change their attitudes, raise their spirits, and seek their cooperation.</p>
