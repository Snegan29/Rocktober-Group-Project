    <h1>How to make impact on Presentations</h1>
    <div class="main-content">
        <p>Most organizations list communication skills as one of their most critical issues…and presentation skills are a large component of communications. Presentation skills are crucial to almost every aspect of academic/business life, from meetings, interviews and conferences to trade shows and job fairs. Often times, leadership and presentation skills go hand in hand. NACE Survey 2016 - Ability to communicate verbally (internally and externally) ranked 4.63/5.0 and was the #1 skill employers want. </p>

        <p> The information provided in this article is designed to provide tips and strategies for delivering an effective presentation, and one that aligns the speaker with the audience.</p>
        <p>When preparing your presentation, in addition to evaluating the technical content needed, you need to understand:
            <ol>
                <li>What type of speaker are you?</li></p>
                <li>FActs and fears of public speaking</li></p>
                <li>Your blueprint for delivery</li></p>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Identify</strong> what type of speaker you are 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoider - </strong> You do everything possible to escape from having to get in front of an audience.</li></p>
                <li><strong>Resister - </strong> You may have to speak, but you never encourage it.</li></p>
                <li><strong>Accepter - </strong> You’ll give presentations but don’t seek those opportunities. Sometimes you feel good about a presentation you gave.</li></p>
                <li><strong>Seeker - </strong> Looks for opportunities to speak. Finds the anxiety a stimulant that fuels enthusiasm during a presentation.</li></p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>About</strong> facts and fears
            <ul>
                <li>Public speaking can create anxiety and fear in many people. Dale Carnegie has a free e-book that provides tips and advice on how to minimize these fears www.dalecarnegie.com/Free-eBook</li></p>
                <li>People are caught between their fear and the fact that many employers expect them to demonstrate good verbal communication skill</li></p>
