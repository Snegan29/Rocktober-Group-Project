    <h1>Why is body Language immportant?</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Did you know that while in India or America a "fantastic" or an "ok" sign is demonstrated by forming a circle with your thumb and forefinger, in Tunisia the same symbol means "I will kill you" and in Japan it means "money"? </p>

            Kinesics or study of body language must be understood by all. Whether it is an interview or a presentation, one must be aware of how to use body language effectively. </p>

            <li><strong> Eye Contact: </strong> Always maintain eye contact with your audience. However, a person must ensure that he/she should not fix his gaze at one person for more than 5 seconds. Too much fluttering of eyes could indicate lack of confidence. Staring at a person could be daunting and hence is not such a good idea.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Hand Shake: </strong>  While shaking hands especially in a professional environment, the hand shake should be firm and not loose. An iron handshake [very strong handshake] can indicate that a person is trying to dominate.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Crossing your Arms: </strong> Crossing your arms could imply that a person is not open to new ideas/opinion especially in case of giving a presentation. However, in a one-on-one interview if the interviewer has his/her arms crossed, the candidate could do the same.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Sitting Posture: </strong> Leaning on a chair is not a good idea. One must sit upright though in a relaxed position. Sitting back in your chair implies lack of interest or rejection.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Gesture: </strong>  Gesture refers to a type of non verbal communication which uses a part of the body with or without verbal communication. Gestures include facial expressions, nods [which is a sign of approval in most cultures], head bobbling/shaking.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Facial Expression: </strong>The face is a best reflection of what a person feels. More often than not it is easy to recognize if a person is happy, sad, anxious, irritated, or excited. It is very important that in a professional scenario a person must control his/her facial expressions. </p> For e.g. If a presenter gets a feel that his presentation is not going on very well, he/she should not show the sign of losing of hope and instead try for a greater involvement from the participants.</li></p>
